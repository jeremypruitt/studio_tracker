== Studio Tracker

Studio Tracker is a web-based app for maanging all (most) aspects of a recording studio. Ever wondered exactly how you got that tone on some guitar track from 6 years ago? By tracking your projects, sessions, songs, tracks, instruments, cables, etc, you can connect them all in the app and recall them as needed.

Studio Tracker also keeps track of your inventory as Devices and Cables. You can then connect devices to cables to devices in order to capture exactly what you used to record that track.

Studio Tracker will also enable you to generate a number of useful reports like track sheets and gantt charts.
